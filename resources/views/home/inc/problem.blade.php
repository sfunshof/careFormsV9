                    In the home care sector, communication between service users and caregivers often falls short, 
                    leading to misunderstandings, unmet needs, and dissatisfaction. 
                    Service users struggle to voice concerns or provide feedback effectively,
                    while caregivers may miss crucial insights into their clients' preferences and
                    requirements, hindering the delivery of personalized care

                    Imagine a scenario where a service user feels their caregiver
                    isn't attentive to their specific needs, but lacks a convenient way to express this. 
                    Conversely, caregivers may feel disconnected from their clients' evolving requirements, 
                    leading to gaps in service quality. Without effective channels for feedback and 
                    communication, the potential for misunderstandings and dissatisfaction looms large, 
                    impacting both the quality of care delivered and the overall satisfaction of all parties
                    involved.
